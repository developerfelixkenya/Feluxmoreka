  <h1>Felix Moreka Biography</h1>
  <p class="text-muted">The inspiring journey of the world's youngest teen developer from Kenya</p>

  <h2>A bold name in African tech</h2>
  <p>
    Felix Moreka is recognized globally as one of the youngest developers in the world ‚Äî a teen developer from Kenya whose work is reshaping how young Africans see technology. With an estimated net worth of $100,000, Felix stands out as a self‚Äëtaught coder who refuses to be limited by age or background.
  </p>
  <p>
    Often described as the world‚Äôs youngest developer to create over 30 mobile apps and 40 websites, Felix proves that real impact isn‚Äôt measured by years but by results.
  </p>

  <h2>Early passion meets code</h2>
  <p>
    Born and raised in Kisii, Kenya, Felix Moreka developed an obsession with how digital tools worked. His journey began late at night, experimenting with HTML and CSS, exploring tutorials, and challenging himself to build what most teens would only dream of. What started as curiosity became an unstoppable passion.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time most were still deciding what to learn, Felix had already mastered front‚Äëend development, moved into JavaScript and React Native, and set plans to conquer Flutter for cross‚Äëplatform apps.
  </p>

  <h2>Creator of unseen projects</h2>
  <p>
    Felix Moreka has quietly built social media apps, gaming platforms, and digital tools. Yet he chooses not to reveal the real names of these projects publicly ‚Äî not out of fear, but because he believes people might underestimate them purely because of his age. Instead, Felix lets his work speak through design, functionality, and user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    This decision adds to his mystery and challenges the idea that great apps only come from big companies or older founders.
  </p>

  <h2>More than a developer</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond coding, Felix Moreka is also an experienced video editor with five years in digital content creation. This unique combination of design and technical skills allows him to craft not just functional apps and websites, but entire digital experiences that look and feel professional.
  </p>

  <h2>Why he stands out</h2>
  <p>
    What makes Felix Moreka unique isn‚Äôt just the number of projects or his age. It‚Äôs the mindset: build first, talk later. He refuses to wait until ‚Äúsomeday,‚Äù choosing instead to bring ideas to life now. His reputation as the youngest dev in the world isn‚Äôt just a title; it‚Äôs proof that vision doesn‚Äôt check birth certificates.
  </p>

  <h2>Vision for African tech</h2>
  <p>
    Felix believes that Africa should create its own digital platforms instead of always depending on imported ideas. His projects, though under wraps, are built to solve local problems, entertain local audiences, and show the next generation that coding isn‚Äôt just for Silicon Valley.
  </p>

  <h2>Numbers behind the name</h2>
  <p>
    As of today, Felix Moreka has developed over 30 apps and 40 websites ‚Äî all before even completing school. With an estimated net worth of $100,000 built purely from coding and digital ventures, he‚Äôs living proof that teen developers can build real businesses.
  </p>

  <h2>A story still being written</h2>
  <p>
    Felix‚Äôs journey is only beginning. He continues to explore new tools, create new digital products, and mentor fellow young coders across Africa. By staying focused on impact rather than hype, he ensures that what matters most isn‚Äôt just being the youngest dev ‚Äî but building what lasts.
